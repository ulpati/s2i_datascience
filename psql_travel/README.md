## Project Overview

Perceptions about the risk of traveling and living in certain foreign countries are often based on information from government agencies or newspapers. This often creates a shared public opinion that is not always based on actual facts.

This project analyzes data released by the U.S. Department of State to determine whether countries labeled as dangerous are actually those where the greatest risks are present.

## Key Findings

Overall, there is a significant relationship between the per capita number of American deaths abroad and the number of warnings a country receives.

Mexico, Mali, and Israel have been flagged by most warning agencies in recent years, but American tourists are more likely to be killed in Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

## Project Goals

- Identify which countries have the highest risk rates and whether they match those indicated in the reports
- Determine which countries have the lowest risk rates
- Perform complex SQL joins across multiple tables to extract and analyze the required data

## Project Submission

The project involves several tables that need to be joined together to obtain the necessary data for analysis.
